# Considerations
* Antennas 
	* Placement
		* Line of sight: Consider the need for a clear line of sight between the transmitting and receiving antennas to minimize obstructions and maximize signal strength.
		- Height and positioning: Optimize antenna placement by positioning them at an appropriate height to avoid obstacles, interference, and to maximize coverage.
		- Environmental factors: Take into account the impact of environmental factors such as buildings, trees, and other physical structures that can attenuate or reflect wireless signals.
	* Type
		* Omnidirectional vs. directional: Determine the appropriate antenna type based on the desired coverage pattern. Omnidirectional (includes dipole) antennas radiate signals in all directions, providing 360-degree coverage, while directional (yagi) antennas focus signals in a specific direction for targeted coverage.
		- Gain: Consider the gain of the antenna, which determines its ability to concentrate the transmitted or received signal in a specific direction. Higher gain antennas can extend coverage and overcome signal loss over longer distances.
	* Polarization
		* Match antenna polarization: Ensure that the transmitting and receiving antennas have the same polarization (e.g., vertical or horizontal) for optimal signal reception and transmission.
		- Mitigate polarization mismatch: In situations where polarization mismatch is unavoidable, such as in diverse network environments, consider the potential impact on signal strength and quality and employ techniques like diversity antennas or polarization diversity to mitigate the effects.
*  Channel Utilization
	* Channel interference: Assess and mitigate potential sources of interference such as neighboring wireless networks, microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, or other devices operating in the same frequency band. Choose channels with minimal interference to optimize network performance.
	- Channel bonding: Consider the use of channel bonding, which combines multiple adjacent channels to increase bandwidth and overall capacity. However, be mindful of potential interference and compatibility with client devices.
* AP Association Time
	* AP placement and density: Ensure proper placement and adequate density of access points (APs) to provide seamless coverage and minimize the time it takes for client devices to associate with an AP when moving between coverage areas.
	- Roaming optimization: Implement techniques like fast roaming (e.g., 802.11r) or dynamic load balancing to reduce AP association time when clients move within the network, improving the overall user experience.
- Site Survey
	- Coverage analysis: Conduct a comprehensive site survey to determine the optimal placement of APs for maximum coverage and signal strength. Identify potential dead zones or areas with weak coverage and address them accordingly.
	- Signal propagation analysis: Assess signal propagation characteristics within the environment, considering factors such as walls, floors, and other physical obstructions that can impact signal strength and quality.
	- Interference assessment: Identify sources of interference and measure their impact on the network, allowing for proper mitigation strategies and channel planning.
	- Capacity planning: Evaluate network capacity requirements, taking into account the number of concurrent users, their bandwidth needs, and the network's ability to handle the anticipated traffic volume.
# Common issues
