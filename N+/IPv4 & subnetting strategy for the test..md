# Things to remember about IPv4
* **BINARY**
	* the decimal values in an octet are as follows 00000000 = 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1
	* you can find the IP range by determing its' value in decimal with all bits right of the cidr set to 1 (High) and 0 (Low)
	*  Network address (LOW): if mask is 255, bring down address. if mask is 0 use 0. 
	* Broadcast address(HIGH): if mask is 255 bring the address, if mask is 0 use 255. 
* **CLASSES**
* bigger number = more networks
	* 10.x is class A (/8)
	* 172.x is class B (/16)
	* 192.x is class C (/24)
* **RANGE**
