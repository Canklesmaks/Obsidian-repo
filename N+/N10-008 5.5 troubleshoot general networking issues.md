# Common issues
* Collisions
	* Collisions occur when two or more devices transmit data on a shared network segment simultaneously, leading to data loss and performance degradation.
	- Common causes include outdated or malfunctioning network equipment, improper network segmentation, or excessive network congestion.
	- To mitigate collisions, network administrators can implement collision detection mechanisms, such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD), or upgrade network infrastructure to support collision-free technologies like full-duplex Ethernet.
* Broadcast Storm
	* - A broadcast storm occurs when a network device, typically a switch, continuously rebroadcasts broadcast or multicast packets, causing excessive network traffic and overwhelming network resources.
	- Broadcast storms are often the result of misconfigured network devices, network loops, or malicious activities.
	- To resolve a broadcast storm, network administrators can identify and eliminate network loops, implement storm control mechanisms on switches, or use techniques like VLANs to segment broadcast domains.\
* Duplicate MAC Address:
	- A duplicate MAC address occurs when two or more devices in a network have the same MAC address, leading to communication conflicts and unpredictable network behavior.
	- Common causes include misconfiguration, cloning MAC addresses, or faulty network devices.
	- Resolving duplicate MAC address issues involves identifying and locating the devices with conflicting MAC addresses and reconfiguring or replacing them to ensure unique MAC addresses.
* Duplicate IP Address:
	* Duplicate IP addresses occur when multiple devices in a network are assigned the same IP address, leading to IP conflicts and communication disruptions.
	- Causes include misconfigured DHCP servers, manual IP address assignment errors, or IP address conflicts due to static IP assignments.
	- To address duplicate IP address issues, network administrators must identify the devices with conflicting IP addresses and reconfigure them to ensure unique IP assignments.
- Multicast Flooding:
	- Multicast flooding occurs when multicast packets are forwarded to all ports on a switch, regardless of whether the receiving devices are interested in the multicast traffic, resulting in unnecessary network congestion.
	- It can be caused by improper multicast group configuration, misconfigured switches, or faulty network equipment.
	- Mitigating multicast flooding involves implementing proper multicast group management, enabling IGMP snooping on switches to limit multicast traffic to interested receivers, or employing multicast routing protocols.
* Asymmetrical Routing
	* Asymmetrical routing occurs when the forward and return paths of network traffic follow different routes, leading to packet loss, performance issues, and potential security vulnerabilities.
	- Common causes include inconsistent routing configurations, load balancing techniques, or asymmetrically configured firewalls.
	- Network administrators can resolve asymmetrical routing by ensuring consistent routing configurations across devices, synchronizing load balancing methods, or properly configuring firewalls to handle both forward and return traffic
* Switching Loops
	* Switching loops occur when multiple network switches are interconnected in a way that creates a looped path, causing broadcast storms, excessive network traffic, and degraded network performance.
	- Switching loops are typically the result of misconfigured Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) settings or unintended physical connections between switches.
	- Resolving switching loops involves implementing STP or other loop prevention mechanisms to disable redundant paths and establish a loop-free topology.
* Routing Loops
	* Routing loops occur when network routers receive and forward packets in a looped manner, leading to packet forwarding loops, excessive network traffic, and routing instability.
	- Routing loops can arise due to incorrect routing configurations, inconsistent routing protocol updates, or convergence issues.
	- Network administrators can address routing loops by properly configuring routing protocols, implementing loop prevention mechanisms, or using techniques like route summarization to reduce routing table complexity.
* Rogue DHCP Server
	* A rogue DHCP server is an unauthorized DHCP server on the network that distributes incorrect or conflicting IP configuration information to clients, causing IP address conflicts and disruptions to network connectivity.
	- Rogue DHCP servers can be introduced by malicious actors or misconfigured devices.
	- Mitigating rogue DHCP server issues involves implementing DHCP snooping and DHCP server authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized DHCP servers from operating on the network.
* DHCP Scope Exhaustion:
	* DHCP scope exhaustion occurs when a DHCP server has assigned all available IP addresses from its configured IP address range, resulting in a lack of available IP addresses for new clients.
	- It can happen due to an insufficient IP address pool, longer lease durations, or a large number of devices connecting to the network.
	- Resolving DHCP scope exhaustion requires expanding the DHCP address pool, adjusting lease durations, implementing DHCP address reservation, or implementing additional DHCP servers to handle the increased demand.
* Incorrect Gateway
	* Consideration: Ensure that the default gateway is correctly configured on devices to enable proper routing between different networks.
	- Troubleshooting: Verify the gateway IP address on the device and ensure it matches the intended network design. Check for misconfigured or unreachable gateway addresses.
- Incorrect Subnet Mask:
	- Consideration: The subnet mask defines the network's addressing scheme and is essential for determining network and host portions of IP addresses.
	- Troubleshooting: Verify the subnet mask configuration on devices and ensure it matches the intended network segmentation. Incorrect subnet masks can lead to communication issues between devices on different subnets.
- Incorrect IP Address:
