	Over the past few months, I've taught myself guitar. I have many musicians in my life who helped me do so in a meaningful way. My brother who is my first musical mentor,(who primarily plays around with keyboards & synthesizers) showed me some guitar theory after I got my instrument and it really piqued my interest in overall music theory. Since then I've learned how to find scale patterns using their formulas, and align myself with a musical key, and all of the major and minor chords. With this knowledge now, I can play with others which has taught me many other things. I'm still learning alot but more than anything I'm having tons of fun.
	I want to become more familiar with the instrument and the relationships of the chords and keys. I don't see myself putting the thing down. My favorite quote so far in the journey comes from a person in my life who has alwasys been talented in the musical art: "They call it -playing- for a reason." Wanda also taught me much (in a very short time) about guitar. You can find her and her music at[https://www.wandaband.com]
