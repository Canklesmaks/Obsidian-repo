* To capture the requests and traffic passing between applications and back-end servers and manipulate these types of requests for testing purposes, we need to use `Web Proxies`.
## What Are Web Proxies?
* Web proxies are specialized tools that can be set up between a browser/mobile application and a back-end server to capture and view all the web requests being sent between both ends 
	* essentially acting as man-in-the-middle (MITM) tools
	* mainly work with web ports such as, but not limited to, `HTTP/80` and `HTTPS/443`.
* essential tools for any web pentester.

## Uses of Web Proxies

While the primary use of web proxies is to capture and replay HTTP requests, they have many other features that enable different uses for web proxies. The following list shows some of the other tasks we may use web proxies for:

- Web application vulnerability scanning
- Web fuzzing
- Web crawling
- Web application mapping
- Web request analysis
- Web configuration testing
- Code reviews
