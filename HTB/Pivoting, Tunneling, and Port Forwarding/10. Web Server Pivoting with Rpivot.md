[Rpivot](https://github.com/klsecservices/rpivot) is a reverse SOCKS proxy tool written in Python for SOCKS tunneling. Rpivot binds a machine inside a corporate network to an external server and exposes the client's local port on the server-side. 
* We will take the scenario below, where we have a web server on our internal network (`172.16.5.135`), and we want to access that using the rpivot proxy.

We can start our rpivot SOCKS proxy server using the below command to allow the client to connect on port 9999 and listen on port 9050 for proxy pivot connections.

#### Cloning rpivot

Web Server Pivoting with Rpivot

```shell-session
canklesmaks@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/klsecservices/rpivot.git
```

#### Running server.py from the Attack Host

Web Server Pivoting with Rpivot

```shell-session
canklesmaks@htb[/htb]$ python2.7 server.py --proxy-port 9050 --server-port 9999 --server-ip 0.0.0.0
```

Before running `client.py` we will need to transfer rpivot to the target. We can do this using this SCP command:
