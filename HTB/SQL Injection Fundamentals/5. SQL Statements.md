## INSERT Statement

The [INSERT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html) statement is used to add new records to a given table. The statement following the below syntax:

Code: sql

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (column1_value, column2_value, column3_value, ...);
```

The syntax above requires the user to fill in values for all the columns present in the table.
